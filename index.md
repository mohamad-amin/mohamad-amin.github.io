## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago ([TTIC](https://ttic.edu/)), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Zhiyuan Li](https://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu/). I received my Master's degree at Computer Science department of The University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Danica J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml/).

I use theoretical and empirical tools to study the practice of Deep Learning.
